                <h2><b>Author: Naomi Ruele</b></h2>
                <p><h5>The use of the internet has changed drastically since the 90s. Social media is entertainment and fun to use but it can also be harmful and hinder child development when used obsessively and unhealthily. Unfortunately the reality is that more people than not do in fact use it as such. From the week’s reading “why youth heart social network sites” the author raised some important questions. “Why do teenagers flock to these sites? What are they expressing on them? How do these sites fit into their lives? What are they learning from their participation?” There are many reasons why people use social media and I interviewed a demographic similar in tastes, schedule and social standing.</h5></p>
                <p><h5>My particular target market was young ladies with hefty schedules and I set out to discover how social media has affected their mental health whether it be in a positive light or a negative one. The results are alarming and very linear. The lives of athletes are already so busy and stressful that mental health is a defining factor in the success of one. I interviewed 12 swimmers and asked them several questions regarding how their mental health and emotional wellbeing is affected by the excess use of social media if it is at all. </p>
                <p><h5>The questions ranged from their extensive use of social media to how their moods changed significantly depending on what it was they saw or viewed and how it affected their mental health. General answers I got supported the theory that there is some sort of correlation between self-confidence and the use of social media. All ladies answered yes to the question “has your use of social media impacted your self-confidence and or mental health significantly?” This is particularly alarming because in the world we live in, social media is hardly avoidable. Employers use it to hire people, people use it to keep in touch with us and so on. Yet its use can have such a toxic effect on people.</h5> 
                </p>
                <p><h5>One particular subject went into more detail stating that she became so engrossed in her use of Instagram that it consumed her to not get a certain amount of likes and she ended up deleting these posts that didn’t garner the attention that she was looking for. She said it affected her confidence so much that she deleted the entire account and went on a hiatus to “re-discover herself”</h5>
                </p>
                <p><h5>Another particular subject said she used social media as a way to keep tabs on her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend’s lives. Though she admitted she was aware of how hurtful the posts she saw would be she stated she could not help it and it would throw her into a “rut” for weeks on end and even affect her school and sport and would give her thoughts of “not being good enough.</h5></p>
                <p><h5>Social media is a very powerful platform and has been used for good but if abused or used wrong it can have detrimental consequences and may even affect one so negatively that their daily lives will suffer. Teens and young people have begun to use it more and more often and if not regulated in a way that it can benefit them I believe mental health will become an even bigger issue than it is now.</h5></p>
