                <h2><b>Think Piece 3</b></h2>
                <p><h5>Judith Butler is a well-known philosopher who has challenged many ideals that have been forged by society. One of her most famous works is her take on gender and gender performativity. What is gender? The dictionary definition identifies it as “the state of being male or female (typically used within biological differences)”. Now can we dispute that it is wrong? No. Can we, however, argue that it is the state of being male, female, gender-fluid, non-binary? The list goes on and the answer is yes. That is what Butler argued. </h5></p>
                <p><h5>Scientifically, people can argue that one person is a certain way because of their biological disposition but I personally do not believe that there are only two genders. With the recent scope of awareness we have had for the LGBT community, society has started to navigate towards a different ideal. The trans-community, for example, is a community of people that have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from their assigned sex. Let us ponder about that for a second. The word “expression”. The process of making one’s thoughts or feelings. Why is it that a person MUST feel the way that a person of their assigned sex feels? What is it to FEEL like a boy? What is it to FEEL like a girl? What constitutes these feelings? Society has warped some sort of reality that tells people that boys like guns and sports and the colour blue. That they are the breadwinners, the decision makers and women? They just carry the children and have pink as their favourite colour. You ask strong believers of this notion why and their response is almost always “that’s just how it has always been”. Girls have always been viewed as weak and in need of nurturing and this stigma is so ingrained within our society and its standards that mentally damaging phrases such as “you run like a girl” or “be a man” have made their way into the norm.                 </h5></p>
                <p><h5>One of my friends identifies as gender-fluid. They use “they/them” pronouns and they do not want to be looked at in society’s eyes as a certain type of gender. They enjoy all aspects of what it means to be a girl and what it means to be a boy and have in the mix created their own kind of fluidity. Many more people are coming out as not possessing any kind of gender regardless of what their sex is. For a while this never made sense to me but then I realized that this has no need for my opinion unless I am an active part of the conversation. Trans people are more comfortable coming out recently and the world is still here. Nothing is changing except the perception of what gender one holds. One person should get to choose that for themselves as that one person knows their body better than anyone else.</h5></p>
                <p><h5>“There is no reason to assume that gender also ought to remain as two. The presumption of a binary gender system implicitly retains the belief in a mimetic relation of gender to sex whereby gender mirrors sex or is otherwise restricted by it.”  This quote is from Judith Butler’s “Gender trouble” and I found it to be powerful and profound in that one’s gender has always been related to one’s sex yet they are two different things. In my bystander experiences I have found that conformity to gender has created all kinds of issues such as the incredible lack of acceptance of lesbian and gay people based on how “they act like different genders” or the stereotypes created of them. Suicides within the LGBT community peak higher than any minority unless you factor in sub-minorities (black LGBTQ, etc) The sooner we start accepting and listening and acknowledging that gender is culturally formed and CAN be changed without harming anyone, the sooner society will be a better place for people to live in.</h5></p>
